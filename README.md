# Project: Practice of convents layers (Computer Vision)

## Overview

<p>We use a convnet to classify MNIST digits</p>

<p>The main code is in the <b>src.py</b></p>


- Our model summary:

<p>The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of channels is controlled by the first
